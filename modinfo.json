	"changeNote": "2021-08-07 - v1.0.28\n- added the ability to spawn in items from the cluster php. (example: get rewards for voting)\n- updated cluster.php. (rotation backups, optional backups with character names; for multichar users)\n- removed temporary feat fix. (no longer needed)\n- optimized feat handling. (this *should* fix reliable buffer overflow issues)\n- added error messages to import logic. (at least the most common ones)",
